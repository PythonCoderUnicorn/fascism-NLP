Gentlemen!

As I begin speaking before you, I feel the thin stilettos of the People's Party, the shiny new revolvers of tripartite liberalism, and even the trombones of social-democracy all pointed at me.

(The assembly laughs. The Duce, after a pause, points his arms at the table, stares fixedly at the crowd and continues in a loud voice).

[...]

I want to salute you, small town men of the good, solid and dependable provinces. I would like you to bring to the too densely populated cities your spirit full of wise depth, your roughness, your calling a spade a spade, the odor of your countryside, the energy of this fantastic agrarian and rural people. (Applause). We must make Fascism a predominantly rural phenomenon. At the bottom of the cities there are all the residues of the old parties, the old sects, the old institutions. The Italian people are predominantly rural: out of the four million combatants, certainly three and a half million were rural. Rural Fascists are the most solid: rural soldiers are the most disciplined. You can ask them to endure fatigue, withstand hardships, and they remain fiercely disciplined.

So many rumors and so many words fill the horizons. Words that come and go and leave no trace; they could fill a volume. First was freedom, which was taken away from the Italian people. (The Duce smiles, folds his arms and, staring straight ahead, says): But the Italian people never asked me for it!

I am very sorry that the Government in these two months, due to political events, has not been able to conduct its ordinary administration, which consists in giving the Italian people streets, aqueducts, houses. (Loud applause).

[...]

On the other hand, you have seen that this crisis has had a utility, since it has allowed us to separate true friends from false friends, and to distinguish the Fascists who have will, passion and faith from those bandwagon Fascists who always pay too much attention to the murmurings of public opinion and who wear the badge only when it is convenient. (Applause). This must end! (Renewed applause).

Gentlemen, anyone is able to sail in a calm sea, when the winds inflate the sails, when there are no waves or cyclones. The truly great and heroic act is being able to sail when the storm is raging. A German philosopher once said: 'Live dangerously'. I would like this to be the motto of Italian Fascism: 'Live dangerously'. This must mean being ready for everything, for any sacrifice, any danger, any action, when it comes to defending the Fatherland and Fascism.
