Italy 1920s Fascists:
- political left = advocated dictatorship of dispossessed
- political center = return to absolute monarchy
- political right = authoritarian corporate state 

German Nat'l Social Party {Nazis}
obviously anti-semite, but also immigration and capitalism
were pro old age pensions and more education for the poor


> Fascism draws energy from [people] who are upset because of a lost war, lost job, some kind of humiliation or a sense their country is in steep decline. the more pain and resentment the easier it is for fascism to promise to take back what was stolen.

Italy grew in fascists due to social problems and Mussolini urged followers to reject capitalism

Fascists vs Socialists:
fascists grew in jobless volunteers who trashed newspaper offices, beat up workers and peasants and police ignored these actions


p.24 Mussolini initiated a campaign to _drenare le palude_ "drain the swamp" by firing more than 35,000 civil servants

1924 Mussolini electoral reform => fascist control
1926 Mussolini abolished political parties , freedom of the press, neutered labor movement, took control of Nat'l Police which led to internal surveillance

Fascist credo "Believe! Obey! Fight!"

Mussolini urged followers to "live dangerously" by renouncing all comforts
