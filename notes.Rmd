> Fascism draws energy from [people] who are upset because of a lost war, lost job, some kind of humiliation or a sense their country is in steep decline. the more pain and resentment the easier it is for fascism to promise to take back what was stolen.

Italy grew in fascists due to social problems and Mussolini urged followers to reject capitalism
